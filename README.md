Advent of Code 2025

So sorry there's only 12 puzzles this year... Only half the fun! :(

This year I will be adding a README file for each day's puzzle, explaining how I approached the solution, auto-generated from the code using an AI tool (VS Copilot) and also containing a generated AI image (an idea I gently borrowed from [encse](https://github.com/encse) as I did last year). I encourage you again to check his solutions as they're super readable and elegant; I learned a lot from them.

**No AI was used to solve the puzzles, only to generate the explanations and images after solving them.**

**All the puzzle creation credit goes to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) crew.**

The puzzles of this repository can be found at: [Advent of Code - 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/)
