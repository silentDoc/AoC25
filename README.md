Advent of Code 2025

So sorry there's only 12 puzzles this year... Only half the fun ! :(

This year I will be adding a readme file for each day's puzzle, explaining how I did approach the solution, auto-generated from the code using an AI tool (VS Copilot) and also containing a gen AI image (an idea I gently borrowed from [encse](https://github.com/encse) as I did last year. I encourage you again to check his solution as they're super readable and elegant, I learnt a lot from them).

**All the puzzle creation credit goes to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) crew**

The puzzles of this repository can be found at : [Advent of Code - 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/)
